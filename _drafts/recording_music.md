For the last 10 years, every week, I write music with my band in the recording studio. We saw it as a great, productive activity that challenged our creativity.
We were writing rock music - guitar, drum, bass. We would warm up, talk about our week, then start off with some ideas or riffs we wrote during the week, or we would create new ideas at the studio. A lot of the music we wrote was heavily influenced by the circumstances surrounding our lives at the time. When we got ideas we liked, we would record them into a track as best as we could and move on to writing the next idea. Sometimes, when feeling extra creative we recorded music as an improvised jam session, then combined the good parts into a song. Sometimes we would not be able to get ideas to complete a song and would leave it as a draft.
We saw our writing develop over the years. There were hints of classical music, blues rock, metal in our writing, depending on the period. We discarded older stuff because it didn't match our current tastes.
It was work, but not as analytic. We took writing music seriously, but we enjoyed it.
We had many roughly recorded songs... but... we never went back to a song to finish it, or record it. They were always rough.

We're always asking ourselves what we can do better, how do we evolve, where do we go from here. So we decided to record some songs for public release as an album. This didn't turn out to be as easy as we though. I had to practice and relearn a lot of material to be able to play it in time with the drums. While our rough recordings were not even close to perfect, it was fast and agile. We got the idea down and then moved on.

Going through this process, I have a lot more appreciation for the artists who make the records I love.
