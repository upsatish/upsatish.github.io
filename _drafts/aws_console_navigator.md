# AWS Console Navigator

Hello!

I am developing AWS Console Navigator browser extension. Go to resources in the AWS console from the Omnibox, by ARN or Resource ID.

Add to Chrome from the Chrome Web Store https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/enlgbafmiepkajfipklgilnljlfbdkbo

Firefox Add-on now available https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/aws-console-navigator/

Useful for AWS developers, DevOps and support. Currently supported resources are listed on the project page https://github.com/upsatish/AWSConsoleNavigator.

To use, type keyword 'awss' space one of the following terms into the Omnibox:
* ARN
* AWS resource ID
* resourceType:resourceID (ARN substring)
* resourceType/resourceID (ARN substring)

See https://github.com/upsatish/AWSConsoleNavigator for README, supported resources, usage examples and documentation.

Sign in to an AWS account is required to access the AWS management console. AWS Console Navigator cannot switch accounts.
